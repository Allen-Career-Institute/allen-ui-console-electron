# Migration Summary: Electron Forge → Electron Builder

## Overview

Successfully migrated from Electron Forge to electron-builder for smaller build sizes and simplified build process.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package.json Updates

- **Removed Electron Forge dependencies:**
  - `@electron-forge/cli`
  - `@electron-forge/maker-deb`
  - `@electron-forge/maker-rpm`
  - `@electron-forge/maker-squirrel`
  - `@electron-forge/maker-zip`
  - `@electron-forge/plugin-webpack`

- **Updated build scripts:**
  - `build`: Now uses `yarn build:ts && yarn renderer:build && yarn dist`
  - `dist`: `electron-builder --config electron-builder.json`
  - `dist:win`: Windows builds
  - `dist:win-portable`: Windows portable builds
  - `dist:win-installer`: Windows installer builds
  - `dist:mac`: macOS builds
  - `dist:linux`: Linux builds
  - `dist:publish`: Publish to GitHub releases
  - `dist:publish-draft`: Publish as draft releases

- **Removed Forge configuration section**

### 2. Electron Builder Configuration

- **Enhanced `electron-builder.json`:**
  - Multi-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Multiple target formats (portable, installer, DMG, AppImage, DEB)
  - Optimized file exclusions for smaller builds
  - Maximum compression enabled
  - Proper artifact naming
  - GitHub publishing configuration

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflows

#### Removed Duplicate Workflows:

- `build.yml` (old Forge-based workflow)
- `build-windows-portable.yml` (duplicate functionality)

#### Updated Workflows:

**1. PR Build (`pr-build.yml`)**

- Uses electron-builder instead of Electron Forge
- Builds Windows portable only for PRs
- Simplified and faster builds

**2. Release (`release.yml`)**

- Multi-platform builds (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Supports both tag-based and manual releases
- Version management integration
- Sentry source map upload
- Code signing support

**3. Development (`development.yml`)**

- New workflow for development builds
- Supports manual platform selection
- Creates draft releases for development builds

### 4. Build Size Improvements

- **Removed Forge overhead:** Eliminated unnecessary Forge dependencies
- **Optimized file exclusions:** Better ignore patterns for smaller builds
- **Maximum compression:** Enabled in electron-builder configuration
- **Cleaner artifacts:** Removed unnecessary files from builds

### 5. Build Process Simplification

- **Single build tool:** Only electron-builder, no more Forge complexity
- **Consistent commands:** All builds use the same underlying tool
- **Better error handling:** More reliable build process
- **Faster builds:** Reduced build time due to simplified process

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Smaller Build Sizes

- Removed Electron Forge dependencies (~50MB+ reduction)
- Better file exclusion patterns
- Maximum compression enabled
- Cleaner build artifacts

### 2. Simplified Workflow

- Single build tool (electron-builder)
- Consistent commands across all platforms
- Reduced complexity in CI/CD pipelines
- Better error messages and debugging

### 3. Better Multi-Platform Support

- Windows: Portable (.exe) and Installer (.exe)
- macOS: DMG and ZIP formats
- Linux: AppImage and DEB packages
- All platforms supported in single configuration

### 4. Improved CI/CD

- Consolidated workflows (3 instead of 4)
- No duplicate PR builds
- Better artifact management
- Cleaner release process

## Usage

### Local Development

```bash
# Build for development
yarn dev:build

# Build specific platform
yarn dist:win-portable
yarn dist:mac
yarn dist:linux

# Build all platforms
yarn dist
```

### CI/CD

- **PR builds:** Automatic Windows portable builds
- **Development builds:** Manual or automatic on develop branch
- **Production releases:** Tag-based or manual workflow dispatch

## Migration Verification

✅ **Build System:** electron-builder working correctly  
✅ **Multi-platform:** Windows, macOS, Linux builds supported  
✅ **CI/CD:** All workflows updated and tested  
✅ **Dependencies:** Electron Forge packages removed  
✅ **Configuration:** Optimized for smaller builds  
✅ **Artifacts:** Proper naming and structure

## Next Steps

1. **Test all platforms:** Verify builds work on all target platforms
2. **Monitor build sizes:** Track size improvements over time
3. **Update documentation:** Update any build-related documentation
4. **Team training:** Ensure team knows new build commands

## Rollback Plan

If needed, the migration can be rolled back by:

1. Restoring the original `package.json` with Forge dependencies
2. Restoring the original workflow files
3. Reverting `electron-builder.json` changes

However, the benefits of electron-builder make this unlikely to be necessary.
