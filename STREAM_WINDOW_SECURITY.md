# Stream Window Security Updates

## Overview

The stream window has been updated to remove user controls for closing and minimizing, making it a
secure, controlled window that can only be managed by the main application.

## Security Changes

### 1. Removed User Controls

- **No Close Button**: Users cannot close the stream window
- **No Minimize Button**: Users cannot minimize the stream window
- **No Window Controls**: Removed all window management buttons from UI

### 2. Window Configuration Updates

```javascript
{
  minimizable: false,    // Disable minimize functionality
  closable: false,       // Disable close button
  maximizable: false,    // Prevent maximization
  fullscreenable: false, // Prevent fullscreen
}
```

### 3. UI Changes

- **Simplified Header**: Removed window control buttons
- **Centered Title**: Title and status are now centered
- **Draggable Only**: Header remains draggable for positioning
- **Clean Design**: Streamlined appearance without controls

### 4. IPC Handler Updates

- **Removed minimize-stream-window**: Handler no longer available
- **Disabled close-stream-window**: Handler commented out in preload
- **Security Focus**: Only essential functionality remains

## Benefits

### Security

- **Controlled Access**: Users cannot accidentally close the stream
- **Session Integrity**: Stream window stays open during entire session
- **No Interruption**: Prevents accidental stream termination

### User Experience

- **Simplified Interface**: Clean, distraction-free design
- **Clear Status**: Connection status prominently displayed
- **Floating Behavior**: Window can still be positioned anywhere

### Application Control

- **Centralized Management**: Main app controls stream window lifecycle
- **Consistent Behavior**: Predictable window behavior
- **Session Management**: Proper cleanup when main app closes

## Implementation Details

### Electron Main Process

- Window creation with disabled controls
- Removed IPC handlers for user window management
- Maintained floating and resizing capabilities

### Web Application

- Simplified header without control buttons
- Enhanced video display with placeholder
- Improved error handling and logging

### CSS Updates

## Usage

### Window Management

1. **Opening**: Stream window opens automatically with meeting config
2. **Positioning**: Users can drag window to desired location
3. **Resizing**: Users can resize window as needed
4. **Closing**: Only possible when main application closes

### Video Display

1. **Initialization**: Shows placeholder during setup
2. **Stream Display**: Video appears when connection established
3. **Controls**: Audio/video mute controls remain available
4. **Status**: Connection status shown in header

## Future Considerations

- **Session Persistence**: Remember window position between sessions
- **Advanced Controls**: Add controlled window management options
- **Themes**: Customizable appearance while maintaining security
- **Analytics**: Track window usage and positioning patterns
